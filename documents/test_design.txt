Test design

Additional considerable test cases:

multi-user testing - is the application able to run in multiple instances in the same time?

input validation (especially on GUI applications) - are unicode/noncharacter strings or 
alphanumeric characters accepted as inputs?

performance - the speed of calculation, response time
related to this: 
static analysis / static review testing of the code to see if the correct data types have been used for the mathematic operations to avoid memory leaks, high CPU or memory consumption

portability - are multiple platforms supported, e.g.: Windows, Macintosh or mobile platforms?

usability - is it from users perspective to convenient to use the application?

stress - running high amount of automated tests to see the application behavior

internalization - to see if the application can load supported language translations upon users choice and translated content appears as expected.

regional - OS time/date and regional settings can affect the display of digits and separators
